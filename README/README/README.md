## Red-team vs Blue-team

This is a report of red-team and blue-team whereI play a role as pestester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, I will attack a vulnerable VM within my environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I will use Kibana to review logs taken during Day 1 engagement. I will use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.

| Name            | IP Address | 
|----------       |---------------------|
| Azura Hypervisor| 192.168.1.1  | 
| Linux           | 192.168.1.8  | 
| ELK server      | 192.168.1.00 | 
| Capstone ( Apache server)| 192.168.1.105 |  

### Step 1

- For these step we will play a role as Red-team.

- Using Nmap scan for webserver's IP Address as we already known we are on the same  subnet.

- The results shows that port 80 TCP was open, port 80 is a vulnerable port because it suppports web traffics that web browsers receive, SQL injection, cross-site request and cross-stie scripting.

- Once I got a website IP a did a bit of reconnaissance by go through a company folders.

<img width="957" alt="sensitive data2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80186549/116966463-97476100-acf3-11eb-8116-6801295c7538.PNG">
<img width="973" alt="sensitive data3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80186549/116966518-b6de8980-acf3-11eb-99f2-b2bc0f185e9b.PNG">

- I found so many useful information to determine my target which is Ashton because he is the one that can access to the secret folder of comapny where I might find something more useful.

- In order to get access I need to brute force Ashton user by using Hydra.

- Now once I got Ashton's user password I log in as Ashton to the secret folder.

- I found a hash value of Ryan which is CEO of the company where I will use his credentials to upload a payload to the website later.

- For this bit I used msfvenom to create a payload called TCP reverse shell.

- Once the payload created I uploaded it to website and exploit it using msfconsole.

- Using cat to view the flag folder then finish the step.

- For the 1 step is now completed.

### Step 2

- For these step we will working as Blue-team looking through logs to determine all of those attack that gone throught the web server.

- Using Kibana to determine the logs and packetbeat to analys it we will see later what is next.

- To determine port scan.
- Search for `source.ip:192.168.1.8 and destination.ip:192.168.1.105`.

- To determine brute force attack.
- Search for ` source.ip:192.168.1.8 and http.response.status_code:401 and user_agent.original:"Mozilla/4.0 (Hydra)"`

<img width="946" alt="blue-team brute_force" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80186549/116966777-4a17bf00-acf4-11eb-87e9-493419288ae0.PNG">

- Add those value to the dashboard.

- To determine how many times they got access to secret folder.
- Search for ` destination.ip:192.168.1.105 and url.path:"/company_folders/secret_folder"`

<img width="906" alt="blue-team secret_folder" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80186549/116966878-73384f80-acf4-11eb-8238-eab10e9ae6c7.PNG">

- Add those value to the dashboard.

 - To determine how many times they got access to webdav.

- Search for `source.ip:192.168.1.8 and destination.ip:192.168.1.105 and url.path:"/webdav"`

<img width="951" alt="blue-team webdav" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80186549/116966912-877c4c80-acf4-11eb-8f6d-14b3dd169a32.PNG">
